Gameplay: 
Description: A game similar to Mario in which the player remains in the center of the screen and the camera pans to keep it that way. Unlike Mario though, leveling up happens by defeating enemies, but if enemies get too close, the character will lose a life! Everytime a level is reached, a new color will be collected. 

Controls:
